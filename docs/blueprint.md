# **App Name**: Webgl Weaver

## Core Features:

- Shader Background: Renders a mesmerizing, animated shader background using WebGL for a visually engaging user interface.
- Responsive Canvas: Dynamically adjusts the WebGL canvas size to fit different screen resolutions, ensuring optimal visualization on all devices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Midnight Blue (#2C3E50) for a deep and sophisticated feel.
- Background color: Dark Navy (#242B37), a slightly lighter desaturated shade of the primary, creating subtle contrast and depth.
- Accent color: Electric Indigo (#6F42C1), a vibrant contrast to the dark backdrop, drawing focus to interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for its clean and modern appearance suitable for UI elements.
- Minimalist and geometric icons complement the shader background, using simple shapes and lines to avoid visual clutter.
- The shader background should stretch full-screen without affecting content layout, acting as a non-intrusive backdrop.
- Subtle, smooth transitions and animations that react to user interactions without detracting from the fluid motion of the WebGL shader.
